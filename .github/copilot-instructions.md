# Copilot Instructions

This file contains instructions for GitHub Copilot to help it generate code that aligns with the project's coding standards and practices. If another AI code assistant is being used, these instructions may also be applicable.

## General Guidelines

- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase.
- Write clear, concise, and maintainable code.
- Include comments and documentation where necessary to explain complex logic, but avoid over-commenting.
- Keep implementations simple and avoid unnecessary complexity. Wait until complexity is justified by actual requirements.
- Follow instructions and prompts provided by the user closely. If you are unsure about a requirement, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions. If you have ideas of what to do next, suggest them to the user for confirmation before proceeding.
