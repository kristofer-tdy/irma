# Welcome to Irma! ðŸ‘‹

Irma is a conversational AI assistant designed to provide expert-level information about FLIR products. This repository contains the source code for the Irma backend services, including the primary REST API that client applications can use to interact with the assistant.

## About the Project

The goal of Irma is to deliver a seamless and intelligent chat experience, enabling users to get quick and accurate answers to their product-related questions. The backend is built with .NET and integrates with Azure AI services to power its conversational capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get acquainted with the project, here are a few good places to start:

- **`/docs/irma-web-api-doc.md`**: The primary design and architecture document for the Irma REST API. It provides a comprehensive overview of the endpoints, data models, and architectural decisions.
- **`/docs/REST-API-spec.yaml`**: The formal OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for the API. You can use this with tools like Swagger UI to interact with the API.
- **`/src`**: The source code for the API and related projects.

We're glad you're here and hope you find Irma interesting. We look forward to your contributions and feedback!
